An x-ray revealed honeycombing on my lungs and my doctor could hear crackling. Following a lung biopsy at hospital, my partner and I were initially told that I did not have IPF – we left the hospital feeling relieved. Unfortunately, the relief was short-lived. At my next routine appointment, another doctor informed me that I did have IPF. This came as a massive shock and I left the hospital feeling unhappy and anxious about the future. When I got home, I told Allison, who was distraught; having previously read that the average life expectancy from diagnosis was 3-5 years.\n",

        "I felt desperate and alone. After such an awful diagnosis, my next appointment was in 6 months and nothing in between.\n",
        "To be diagnosed with IPF is absolutely devastating ... You are told you have three to five years to live ... It’s a very, very scary proposition.\n",

We had a diagnosis and now could start on a path of monitoring this to hopefully prevent any further complications.\n",

        "I was told I had Interstitial Lung Disease and Pneumonitis which resulted in scarring and a partially collapsed left lung in early 2019 when I had been on MTX. Is that pulmonary fibrosis? I don’t know. I’m about to be referred to a Respiratory consultant (again) as I have a blood clot in each lung and so will ask for an explanation of all the different terms.\n",
        "… but had always been diagnosed as something else, such as pneumonia. This unfortunately led to countless, useless prescriptions of antibiotics; to post-nasal drip; to possibly tuberculosis (simple tests proved otherwise). Luckily, my new and astute physician decided that the problem was greater and a referral to a respirologist confirmed IPF.\n",
        "I was referred to a respirologist and put on a high dose steroid, and a bronchodilator inhaler. Several tests followed and finally in December 2010, based on a lung biopsy, I was diagnosed with IPF that had already reduced my lung function by 40%.\n",

        "I was diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis approx 5 years ago. My respiratory consultant believes it RA related and I’ve no reason to doubt him as I’m as sure as I can be that my lungs were damaged during a prolonged RA flare.\n",
        "Am going to a connective tissue consultant… as my rheumatologist consultant thinks this would help me better.\n",
        "My hospital has a scleroderma specialist, thankfully! I had been treated for pulmonary fibrosis there. Some other issues landed me with rheumatology, but they seem to have a few multidisciplinary specialists that see scleroderma patients, which is great.'''\n",

        "I can now restore my breathing by remaining as calm as possible and inhaling through my nose. […] I find that drinking water and keeping hydrated, having a small, low sugar sweet in my mouth (liquorice is quite effective) and having small meals, help me to reduce my cough.\n",

I mean, this is just mind over matter for sure, but that feeling of air just on her face calmed her down.\n",
        "The decision to start treatment was mine, but it was based on my lung specialist’s advice because I am a layman.\n",
        "I made the decision. I had to make my physician aware of the treatments to get them.\n",
        "I asked the ILD specialist about which drug he would recommend, I was recommended Esbriet. However, I did NOT want to take a treatment that required me taking 9 tablets a day on top of all my heart medication that I already take.\n",

Apparently some rheumatologists don’t like prescribing baricitinib to people with lung conditions but I’ve been taking it for approx. 2 years without any detrimental effect on my lungs so far. My respiratory consultant advised me to stop taking methotrexate which I was on when diagnosed. Rheumy have stopped me taking all other DMARDs too, which I think is because of my pulmonary fibrosis.\n",
        "The lack of multidisciplinary team plays a role here. For instance, physiotherapy is not contemplated as part of the process. The multidisciplinary team should not only include lung specialists, radiologists and pathologists, it should also include physiotherapists.\n",
        "For a few months, I’ve been using ambulatory oxygen. I had struggled with the concept, as I saw it as a sign my condition was progressing. But now I see it as a way of allowing me to continue to do the things I want to do and as an important safeguard.\n",
        "[Being on oxygen] enables you to carry on doing the things that you want to do… at least it enables you to go out and do some exercise… go off to the park, go and see friends… I think the way people think of oxygen needs to change… that it’s a positive thing.\n",
        "I didn’t want to go on oxygen because it was accepting or confirming that I was getting worse. When I look back on it, I should have been on supplementary oxygen 6 months or more before.\n",
        "To slow down the scarring of my lungs, I was prescribed pirfenidone. Initially I had a lot of side effects: nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and a skin rash which meant I had to put on SPF50 sunscreen whenever I went out in the sun. I also felt very fatigued sometimes and would need to take short breaks during the day. But I tolerated all this as it was slowing the rate of progression of the scarring on my lungs.\n",
        "Corticosteroids made me feel like a balloon.\n",
        "Going out is always a challenge because I worry about running out of oxygen.\n",
        "The three most common challenges I’ve faced are travelling with oxygen, getting the appropriate oxygen for home use, and exercising with oxygen.\n",
        "I was amazed at how useful it was; it told me things I feel my GP should have; things I needed to know. It gave me the confidence to go to the gym, even with my oxygen. I met a friend on the course and we went together and both exercised with our oxygen.\n",
        "At the course I found out breathing techniques that I still use today, years later. It helped me to cope and accept my condition.\n",
        "I did pulmonary rehab and it really helped. But because I’ve already done it, and there’s such a waiting list, I haven’t gone back.\n",
        "The doctor suggested I go again recently, and I said to the doctor I don’t really feel I can do it. Or have the energy. And then my husband would have to drive me, and it’s just sheer distance.\n",
        "What really helped me was going to a pulmonary rehab program. That was a way of being able to start getting back into exercising, and activity, and wellness exercises, and connecting with other people who have lung issues.\n",
        "The fitter your body is, the better you feel both physically and mentally. If you feel better mentally then your whole well-being is more positive and you won’t dwell on the negative sides of the disease.\n",
        "Palliative care can be very useful… you can get medication… assistance, help with nutritional changes, and also participate in relaxation techniques, and get advice on social, emotional and spiritual… Psychological support is very, very important.\n",
        "I often forget to take the one pill I have to take weekly.\n",
        "I prefer to experience diarrhoea than a headache as my line of work requires lots of concentration. I tend to gain weight — specifically, corticosteroids made me feel like a balloon. I believe that at the end of the day… any side effects worsen quality of life.\n",
        "If they are all severe, diarrhoea is the hardest… every moment of the day going to the toilet can be embarrassing and hits that physical and pride level.\n",
        "The most common thing that a lot of people can’t manage is the diarrhoea, because you’re literally at home and you can’t go anywhere.\n",
        "The sun sensitivity is especially inconvenient as my wife comes from the Caribbean and still wants to travel there and then it would be severe to travel there with such a risk of side effects.\n",
        "I’m already on a cocktail of pills and taking nine more a day is too much to ask.\n",
        "However, in June 2017, test results indicated that the medication wasn’t slowing the scarring as much as was hoped. So, I was switched to the only other available and relatively new drug, nintedanib. I was a bit nauseous initially, but I’ve found a good regime and manage my diet.\n",
        "I was prescribed Esbriet at first but experienced intolerable side effects so the drug was exchanged for OFEV. Is it working? Well, my spirometry test shows little minimal change in the last 6 months.\n",
        "Some people like me don’t can’t seem to absorb or respond to the Zentevia brand and only do well with the Bristol Brand/Quinoric Brand… Mine was switched in July and I landed up in hospital for 6 weeks. I never dreamt that it could be due to a medication brand switch but it was.\n",

It was scary to think that my dad had only possibly 5 years to live, but because he hadn’t changed much (apart from a consistent cough), the terminal diagnosis hadn’t quite hit home ... His use of oxygen tanks was a big adjustment at first, and at times was difficult to see. But we knew he needed it to continue being as active as possible.’\n",

        "Most oxygen providers will provide a home concentrator and either tanks or a portable oxygen concentrator (POC). Initially I ended up purchasing a POC out of pocket because it was difficult to get through insurance. Tanks are very heavy and, depending on your flow rate, you may have to carry more than one tank with you. Last fall I was prescribed a POC with a low continuous flow capability and it took over two months, and several follow-up calls by me… oxygen deliveries can be unreliable and sometimes require that you be home for a full day.\n",

        "I would expect them to tell me potential adverse events … long term adverse events. I would like them to let me know about them … I always take into account whether it will be detrimental as well for me in terms of adverse events.\n",

        "Well, I guess that my primary care physician would like to hear about the … regular testing that I will be undergoing throughout the clinical trial … he refers me to other doctors … therefore it’ll be very important for him to know about those tests, the outcomes, the results, how those tests were done.\n",

I think it goes around the same idea of the peer group or being linked to this trial beyond just a medical fact, the fact that it’s personally and psychologically giving her something.\n",
        "Well when you have a peer group you can feel more supported. Psychologically it’s really helpful at least for me as a caretaker and for my mom as a patient to be able to share her experience with someone who’s going through the same thing, I think that’s very helpful.\n",
        "At least in studies that I’ve seen, I’ve never seen study partner caregiver compensation. I highly encourage it because they have costs, and they have skin in the game.\n",

        "No, the thing that worried me was, if he had to stop any of his meds that he was on now ... when I saw the list of meds, he wouldn’t have to stop any of his regular meds and be taking placebo. I was OK with that even if he was just taking placebo.\n",
        "We went to different hospitals, and they said it’s a sequela of COVID and so we can’t do anything with that. And they don’t have any experience so we can’t do anything.\n",
        "They say you are like this and that’s how you are going to end up like. And you think, what’s going to happen in between?\n",

        "I was pleased it wasn’t cancer.\n",
        "Doctors should be sensitive when delivering a diagnosis and prognosis to patients. The delivery of a diagnosis should not be rushed as the news is life changing. Time should not be an issue.\n",
        "If somebody says to you it’s mild, moderate or severe, all that immediately goes through your mind is does that mean I have a short life or a long one? It doesn’t tell you what you’re faced with.\n",
        "It took me years to get diagnosed and I know this can isolate you so much because you just feel you need to know what is wrong with you so you can deal with it.\n",
        "It is extremely unsettling to have a disease that people say is rare and incurable. The research that I did on ILD was also hopeless pointing to low 5 and 10 year survival rates ... I had a lot of unanswered questions: How would my appearance change? Would I suffer? What other organs would be impacted after my lungs? What did I need to do to ensure the financial stability of my family? What did I need to do so that my family did not need me anymore?\n",
        "The diagnosis was communicated to me in a realistic manner. There is no treatment and no cure but – I remember the doctor emphasised that but – but there is a medicine that gives encouraging results.\n",
        "Being told you have this and there is nothing you can do is frightening. I was told that I wasn’t suitable for transplant, so I felt in a position of no hope. I just had to sit down and take what was coming with no hope, and that was the worst of all.\n",
        "I was told my life expectancy was two to five years and then I was scheduled for a check-up for six months later. I was referred to a physiotherapist to learn breathing exercises. That was it – no other information or support was given.\n",
        "More thought should be given to the psychological impact of being diagnosed with this devastating disease.\n",
        "We were not given a lot of information. Most of what I learned was from attending a support group. I was told when the illness was diagnosed that it was terminal, which came as a shock to both me and my wife.\n",
        "I didn’t know what to do initially ... I tried looking at the internet and the information that was available managed to confuse me even more.\n",
        "I think at diagnosis, obviously, you need to be told that this is not curable and it’s progressive and it will end your life.\n",
        "I think information can be provided in [the] way of a website, or even at the respiratory clinics, little leaflets for people to take. For example, having problems with exercise or keep healthy eating or, you know, when you’re feeling down, these are the resources.\n",
        "[Information] should be available to you very early on, to put you onto the right track of exercise and diet.\n",
        "I think that [what] the website should include, is that you’re not going to keel over from just exerting yourself a little bit. I was really frightened to do any exercise in case I made things worse.\n",
        "The missing link for patients is the lack of information among the GPs. They are not informed about the disease and, in turn, they cannot properly advise patients or refer them to the right specialists.\n",
        "We knew nothing about pulmonary fibrosis when mum received her diagnosis and immediately researched it. Google was not kind and we couldn’t believe something so cruel and terminal was unheard of. Anyone we spoke to about pulmonary fibrosis also hadn’t heard about pulmonary fibrosis and we soon became educators. This really needs to change. There has to be more awareness and support for pulmonary fibrosis sufferers and their families.\n",
        "It was so hard to find information and any doctors or nurses we did talk to had never had a patient with IPF before. So what they maybe heard about or they were comparing it to COPD or other diseases that it really can’t be compared to. There was no information and it was really hard to find, and it felt like we were completely on our own. From what I found online, it was scary; but I figured if that was the case, then her doctor would tell us.\n",
        "[In the context of advanced care planning and end-of-life care] I don’t think the GP knows enough about IPF to be honest because in my experience, they have heard of it but they might have one patient with it but it seems like by the time people are diagnosed, they are too far gone; or it just seems like it’s getting easier to diagnose ... Even the Palliative Care Nurse didn’t know about the oxygen testing and didn’t know about lung disease at all ... So I think they need to be more educated.'''\n",

Google was not kind and we couldn’t believe something so cruel and terminal was unheard of. Anyone we spoke to about pulmonary fibrosis also hadn’t heard about pulmonary fibrosis and we soon became educators. This really needs to change. There has to be more awareness and support for pulmonary fibrosis sufferers and their families.\n",
        "It was so hard to find information and any doctors or nurses we did talk to had never had a patient with IPF before. So what they maybe heard about or they were comparing it to COPD or other diseases that it really can’t be compared to. There was no information and it was really hard to find, and it felt like we were completely on our own. From what I found online, it was scary; but I figured if that was the case, then her doctor would tell us.\n",
        "[In the context of advanced care planning and end-of-life care] I don’t think the GP knows enough about IPF to be honest because in my experience, they have heard of it but they might have one patient with it but it seems like by the time people are diagnosed, they are too far gone; or it just seems like it’s getting easier to diagnose ... Even the Palliative Care Nurse didn’t know about the oxygen testing and didn’t know about lung disease at all ... So I think they need to be more educated.'''\n",

Especially in those smaller centers, where maybe the doctor has never seen this before. I believe it is important that healthcare professionals are honest with patients. The nurse and the respiratory therapist decide on a plan. The nurse communicates with the ILD physician or the rehabilitation/palliative respiratory care physician. \"They handle all of that really well,\" patient says. We were terrified to have those conversations but once we knew for sure that was what was happening, we made it a point to talk about it openly and talk about her fears and concerns.

        "[Coughing] can cause me to vomit ... that impacts on myself and my family, keeping us awake at night particularly.\n",
        "Feelings of weakness and breathlessness overtake the enjoyment and ability to do much.\n",
        "I found myself persistently short of breath, fatigued, and dealing with a cough that wouldn’t subside.\n",
        "Coughing all the time is exhausting. I have little energy to do as I like, like spending time with my grandchildren.\n",
        "Patients also report weight loss as a symptom of PF:\n",
        "Weight loss seems to be part and parcel of IPF and mine has dropped from 90kg to about 67kg now, so you have to eat what you need to maintain health.\n",
        "That’s been progressive and weight loss ... and very low BMI and advanced nutritional support.\n",
        "If it’s really cold outside… it hurts me to go outside. It really hurts my lungs. Heat and humidity really, really take their toll. Allergy season is crazy.\n",
        "Patients’ also describe the progressive worsening of symptoms over time:\n",
        "I first noticed my breathing problems on a long-haul flight and struggled with my breathing while I was away. I thought it was a virus, but after some planned surgery the following month I developed a cough, struggled with my breathing and was admitted to the emergency department ... At times I’d feel fine, then going upstairs would leave me incredibly breathless. I developed a persistent cough and felt tired a lot of the time.\n",
        "As the disease progressed the coughing became more prevalent. It affected simple day acts; I’d cough when I laughed, after eating and in atmospheres where there are smells of chemicals, perfumes and aerosol deodorants, or spaces too hot or cold. The cough has increased and sounds different as the time passes. The sound of my cough is more grave and I now cough for longer periods.\n",
        "Flare-up of symptoms is reported to be severely debilitating:\n",
        "In May 2018 I had a flare-up of my symptoms while in Rome due to a respiratory infection. I was coughing all day and night, and couldn’t sleep. It took about 8 weeks and some pretty strong antibiotics to shift it completely.\n",
        "I have a constant dry cough. Very annoying. I am on supplemental oxygen 24 hours a day. I even have canisters that I use when I go outside of the house. But it’s a pain... I have some days where it’s not really that bad. I have some days where it is so severe that it’s – I cough to the point that I throw up because I’m coughing so much.\n",
        "My symptoms were heavy labored breathing when I did normal tasks such as climbing a flight of stairs and numbness and discoloration in my toes and fingers or Raynaud’s syndrome.\n",
        "I feel like the last couple of months I’ve been feeling more fatigue than I have in the past… Sometimes there [are] things I have to do, so I kind of work through it, but, you know, when I, when I don’t lie down and I still go to work and still do things, it drains me even more.\n",
        "Sometimes I get chest pain. It comes and goes, but it mostly feels like somebody really heavy, like I feel a 400-pound person, like I got an extra body sitting on me.\n",
        "I couldn’t walk along freely without oxygen. I had to have somebody nearby just in case, because I have these dizzy spells and sometimes I would pass out.\n",
        "It’s just one of those feelings where [it’s] kind of like you panic. You know, you want air in. Because you need air to breathe, and if you don’t have air you just feel all discombobulated. That’s kind of a weird feeling.\n",
        "I was diagnosed in 2007 with Pulmonary Fibrosis because of Lupus an autoimmune disease which caused the damage to my lungs.\n",

        "Patients with PF caused by taking medications for their atrial fibrillation:\n",
        "I have pulmonary fibrosis caused by the treatment I had for AF. I had amiodarone, which is known to cause lung problems, and then dronedarone, which is safer. Unfortunately, I developed pulmonary fibrosis.\n",
        "I too have pulmonary fibrosis, diagnosed 4 years ago and caused by the drug I was taking for my atrial fibrillation, which was then stopped, but the damage was done. I also have other health problems with my heart and lungs.\n",
        "When I initially started, I was itching every day, and it would keep me up at night. It was just constantly itching.\n",
        "At the beginning, when I was first diagnosed, I used to be a really, severe Raynaud’s where just touching the fingers were painful.\n",
        "I also have severe osteoarthritis in both knees.\n",
        "Where now, I don’t have that sensitivity in the fingertips. It will turn purple; it will hurt but not as bad as in the beginning when I was diagnosed. I used to get sores-I used to get digital ulcers and scars and sores, and now I don’t. Fingers turn blue but I don’t get the sores.\n",

        "I started experiencing a buildup of mucus in my throat causing a constant clearing and coughing. The colour was always clear so, since both my family doctor and I felt it was post nasal drip, I was prescribed nasal sprays.\n",
        "Before my diagnosis I’d been feeling some pain on my lower back that wouldn’t go away. I also noticed that I often needed to cough to clear my throat before having a conversation but I wouldn’t call it severe.\n",
        "It took around 2 weeks for her to be diagnosed after being taken to A&E at Hammersmith Hospital, London when she felt her breathing was not right. I remember being told at the time that her lungs were too weak for a biopsy to be done to confirm her diagnosis. Shortly after, she was given a prognosis of 5 years. This was a massive shock and we felt totally winded. It was unexplainable for us and felt surreal.\n",
        "I first mentioned my cough to my GP at my annual health check in 2013. The X-ray came back clear. But a year later, another X-ray showed something on my left lung. Lots of tests were inconclusive, but finally the results of a surgical lung biopsy indicated I had IPF.\n",
        "It took 2 years of back and forth to get to this stage!\n",
        "Then we moved and I saw a new GP. I was sent for a CT scan almost immediately, which showed that there was damage in my airways. I was told I had pulmonary fibrosis and referred to hospital. After a lung biopsy and further tests I was finally diagnosed, three years after my first visit to the GP.\n",
        "At the age of 4, I was diagnosed with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis… we counted ourselves lucky that it appeared I had the presentation where it attacks primarily the joints. We didn’t realize this would later take our journey down another path… My childhood had its aches and pains. After college was when things really started to change. I was diagnosed with double pneumonia shortly after graduating… Blood tests, CT scans and a lung biopsy eventually confirmed a diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis in 2011. My family and I later found out that rheumatoid arthritis caused my pulmonary fibrosis.\n",
        "I was diagnosed with double pneumonia shortly after graduating. After recovering, I still had a cough that I couldn’t shake no matter how many over-the-counter or prescription edications I tried, and while I was far from an athlete before, the shortness of breath was slightly more noticeable now.\n",
        "At first I was told I had arthritis, then rheumatoid arthritis. Lupus was also diagnosed and I was given treatments for them all. Nothing helped and I only got worse ... he ran a myriad of tests; X- rays, blood and urine ... and told us that I had scleroderma with CREST and pulmonary fibrosis.\n",
        "My breathing complications became really bad so my chest specialist thought that I had a condition called bronchiectasis and did [an] MRI scan to detect it. This came back clear of bronchiectasis but he said we did find pulmonary fibrosis on the scan.\n",

        "### Misdiagnosis ###\n",
        "\n",
        "My dad was misdiagnosed for five years and was finally told he had IPF one week before he died.\n",
        "I changed respirologists part way through (the process of being treated) because I wasn’t getting the information I wanted.\n",
        "Doctor (diagnoses) with fibermyalgia [sic] and prescribed prednisone 40mg… My arthritis results came back negative… Upon visiting a physician he noticed that my oxygen is very very low… had CT scan with contrast of my entire chest where they discovered fibrosis.\n",
        "I was first diagnosed with bronchiectasis in 2002. It took till 2011 before I discovered that I had pulmonary fibrosis.\n",
        "I got a really bad respiratory flu. I didn’t recover in 10 or 12 days… and at first they thought it was COPD.\n",
        "My health had been deteriorating for quite a while running up to my IPF diagnosis in 2015. In early 2014, I had been experiencing severe chest pains. An x-ray revealed honeycombing on my lungs and my doctor could hear crackling. Following a lung biopsy at hospital, my partner and I were initially told that I did not have IPF – we left the hospital feeling relieved. Unfortunately, the relief was short-lived. At my next routine appointment, another doctor informed me that I did have IPF. This came as a massive shock and I left the hospital feeling unhappy and anxious about the future. When I got home, I told Allison, who was distraught; having previously read that the average life expectancy from diagnosis was 3-5 years.\n",
        "Very shocked. Really upset at the time. Coming to terms with it slowly.\n",
        "They gave me a booklet and I wish I didn’t read it.\n",
        "To give it to someone as soon as they diagnosed it, I think it was not a good idea.\n",
        "While the diagnosis itself might be clearly explained at the time, patients report a subsequent lack of support and information:\n",
        "After diagnosis, I have been left on my own to cope, with no help from anyone.\n",
        "Things were very confusing at this time for me, and I remember wondering why I was being admitted, because I didn’t feel particularly worse than I had in the months prior.\n",
        "I felt desperate and alone. After such an awful diagnosis, my next appointment was in 6 months and nothing in between.\n",
        "To be diagnosed with IPF is absolutely devastating ... You are told you have three to five years to live ... It’s a very, very scary proposition.\n",
        "I guess the reason why I felt so surprised was that there was no mention of pulmonary fibrosis in the years prior, when I had multiple episodes of flu, bronchitis, pneumonia.\n",
        "It was a bit of a shock to the system ... we thought it was just a chest infection ... he had a little cough but nothing too much.\n",
        "Initially it was a huge shock to discover that he had IPF, which I had never heard of.\n",
        "Given that I am a life-long non-smoker and never knowingly worked in a hazardous environment, I couldn’t fathom my diagnosis. Why me and IPF?\n",
        "I feel picked on, I feel I haven’t smoked for all these years, I don’t drink, I’m not overly fat, why is this happening to me?\n",
        "My general practitioner had no idea what was wrong with me. I used to feel upset when I left his office as I knew he did not believe what I was telling him.\n",
        "I was diagnosed with Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) caused by scleroderma at the end of October in 2012… My first reaction was disbelief especially when I was told that one of the ‘treatments’ would be chemotherapy.\n",
        "Blood tests, CT scans and a lung biopsy eventually confirmed a diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis in 2011. My family and I later found out that rheumatoid arthritis caused my pulmonary fibrosis. I was shocked, but I was determined to see the bright side of things. We had a diagnosis and now could start on a path of monitoring this to hopefully prevent any further complications.\n",
        "At the time of diagnosis I had no symptoms, I was athletic and completely healthy. I had no idea the impact it would come to have on my life.\n",
        "I was told I had Interstitial Lung Disease and Pneumonitis which resulted in scarring and a partially collapsed left lung in early 2019 when I had been on MTX. Is that pulmonary fibrosis? I don’t know. I’m about to be referred to a Respiratory consultant (again) as I have a blood clot in each lung and so will ask for an explanation of all the different terms.\n",
        "… but had always been diagnosed as something else, such as pneumonia. This unfortunately led to countless, useless prescriptions of antibiotics; to post-nasal drip; to possibly tuberculosis (simple tests proved otherwise). Luckily, my new and astute physician decided that the problem was greater and a referral to a respirologist confirmed IPF.\n",
        "I was referred to a respirologist and put on a high dose steroid, and a bronchodilator inhaler. Several tests followed and finally in December 2010, based on a lung biopsy, I was diagnosed with IPF that had already reduced my lung function by 40%.\n",
        "Have [sic] been diagnosed this by my respiratory consultant due to decrease in my lung function tests.\n",
        "I was diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis approx 5 years ago. My respiratory consultant believes it RA related and I’ve no reason to doubt him as I’m as sure as I can be that my lungs were damaged during a prolonged RA flare.\n",
        "Am going to a connective tissue consultant… as my rheumatologist consultant thinks this would help me better.\n",
        "My hospital has a scleroderma specialist, thankfully! I had been treated for pulmonary fibrosis there. Some other issues landed me with rheumatology, but they seem to have a few multidisciplinary specialists that see scleroderma patients, which is great.\n",

        "I was diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis in 2004 and subsequently got Pulmonary Hypertension as well. A year ago I was prescribed Hydroxychloroquine Sulfate.\n",
        "I’m on a drug called nintedanib which I’ve been on for 4 years. I had to have the dose lowered to reduce side effects. We’re both also on long-term oxygen therapy.\n",
        "I’ve been on nintedanib for nearly a year now. The drug isn’t expected to improve things as scarring can’t be reversed but it is hoped it will stop or slow down progression. I did feel better straight away but I am also taking steroids.\n",
        "Ambulatory oxygen is very important – it helps me keep active.\n",
        "I’ve recently been given an Inogen one oxygen concentrator. It only gives oxygen when you breathe through the tubes up your nose.\n",
        "Patients describe having a strong support system in place as being important:\n",
        "Eventually you become dependent on supplementary oxygen for exercise initially and then 24/7 at home just to stay alive.\n",
        "You’re using your own supports whether it’s your friends, my telephones been burnt out. It’s just staying in touch with people, that’s kind of what gets you through the day.\n",
        "Yoga, meditation, just going out for a walk, I mean all of those things definitely helped.\n",
        "I started with the garden benches [home improvement project]. It’s just something to keep you going... keep the mind busy on something else… The more you sit around watching the television, the more things will get into your mind.\n",
        "Patient groups also provide a powerful coping mechanism:\n",
        "There was company, people with the same disease. I found I was looking forward to going. And I thought it was doing me good.\n",
        "Just having a chat about families and how they are coping, you know that’s the biggest part of it. Getting together and talking to people with the same problem.\n",
        "However, the influence was not consistently positive:\n",
        "‘I couldn’t help thinking that [the patient group meeting] is like\n",
        "[Dr Harold Shipman’s] waiting room, waiting for each one to pop off you know. Because there is always news that somebody is gone and that’s a person you know and I think, my name would be there one day wouldn’t it?’ (Dr Harold Shipman was a UK physician convicted of euthanasia of elderly patients)\n",
        " ... [There was a negative] down turn because you all know that you are going sooner than you’d like to be.\n",
        "It’s sort of monitoring yourself and knowing what your capacity is, and if it’s… you’re getting to a… sort of a point where you need to take a break, well take a break you know, that’s all. I guess you learn yourself where those points are.\n",
        "I think by, referring how it affects me to somebody else, may not help them at all, yet it helps me. And that’s why I’m saying, I think it’s sort of very individual.\n",
        "That means that I have to be aware, more aware… and try and make sure [I] eat properly, exercise, monitor my oxygen requirements.\n",
        "I have to, just get into a routine and acceptance of that, and find the little pockets of positivity within that well.\n",
        "Preparing oneself for… acceptance of the illness, not just acceptance of the illness, but acceptance of the illness that where it’s going to take you, as in, in the end, you will die. But um, you can’t just put that out of your mind.\n",
        "I know they (family) care and I know they’re gonna be there for me and that’s a big, a big plus, whether it’s on an emotional level or a physical level, they would do anything to help me that they could.\n",
        "I can now restore my breathing by remaining as calm as possible and inhaling through my nose. […] I find that drinking water and keeping hydrated, having a small, low sugar sweet in my mouth (liquorice is quite effective) and having small meals, help me to reduce my cough.\n",
        "I do find that my mouth dries out so I must do some mouth breathing, cause I’m sort of constantly putting on, you know, lip balm during the day, and at nighttime too.\n",
        "My mother died of lung disease, she had fibrosis, so she had scarring all over her lungs and eventually it covered her lung and I mean, there’s no way you can breathe after a while, and I know this is mind over matter, but do you know those little propeller handheld fans? I mean, this is just mind over matter for sure, but that feeling of air just on her face calmed her down.\n",
        "The decision to start treatment was mine, but it was based on my lung specialist’s advice because I am a layman.\n",
        "I made the decision. I had to make my physician aware of the treatments to get them.\n",
        "I asked the ILD specialist about which drug he would recommend, I was recommended Esbriet. However, I did NOT want to take a treatment that required me taking 9 tablets a day on top of all my heart medication that I already take.\n",
        "My pulmonary fibrosis is due to Rheumatoid Arthritis [RA], the RA is being actively treated but constantly getting pneumonia requiring hospital admissions.\n",
        "A low dose of Baracitinib for my RA. Apparently some rheumatologists don’t like prescribing baricitinib to people with lung conditions but I’ve been taking it for approx. 2 years without any detrimental effect on my lungs so far. My respiratory consultant advised me to stop taking methotrexate which I was on when diagnosed. Rheumy have stopped me taking all other DMARDs too, which I think is because of my pulmonary fibrosis.\n",
        "The lack of multidisciplinary team plays a role here. For instance, physiotherapy is not contemplated as part of the process. The multidisciplinary team should not only include lung specialists, radiologists and pathologists, it should also include physiotherapists.\n",
        "For a few months, I’ve been using ambulatory oxygen. I had struggled with the concept, as I saw it as a sign my condition was progressing. But now I see it as a way of allowing me to continue to do the things I want to do and as an important safeguard.\n",
        "[Being on oxygen] enables you to carry on doing the things that you want to do… at least it enables you to go out and do some exercise… go off to the park, go and see friends… I think the way people think of oxygen needs to change… that it’s a positive thing.\n",
        "I didn’t want to go on oxygen because it was accepting or confirming that I was getting worse. When I look back on it, I should have been on supplementary oxygen 6 months or more before.\n",
        "To slow down the scarring of my lungs, I was prescribed pirfenidone. Initially I had a lot of side effects: nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and a skin rash which meant I had to put on SPF50 sunscreen whenever I went out in the sun. I also felt very fatigued sometimes and would need to take short breaks during the day. But I tolerated all this as it was slowing the rate of progression of the scarring on my lungs.\n",
        "Corticosteroids made me feel like a balloon.\n",
        "Going out is always a challenge because I worry about running out of oxygen.\n",
        "The three most common challenges I’ve faced are travelling with oxygen, getting the appropriate oxygen for home use, and exercising with oxygen.\n",
        "I was amazed at how useful it was; it told me things I feel my GP should have; things I needed to know. It gave me the confidence to go to the gym, even with my oxygen. I met a friend on the course and we went together and both exercised with our oxygen.\n",
        "At the course I found out breathing techniques that I still use today, years later. It helped me to cope and accept my condition.\n",
        "I did pulmonary rehab and it really helped. But because I’ve already done it, and there’s such a waiting list, I haven’t gone back.\n",
        "The doctor suggested I go again recently, and I said to the doctor I don’t really feel I can do it. Or have the energy. And then my husband would have to drive me, and it’s just sheer distance.\n",
        "What really helped me was going to a pulmonary rehab program. That was a way of being able to start getting back into exercising, and activity, and wellness exercises, and connecting with other people who have lung issues.\n",
        "The fitter your body is, the better you feel both physically and mentally. If you feel better mentally then your whole well-being is more positive and you won’t dwell on the negative sides of the disease.\n",
        "Palliative care can be very useful… you can get medication… assistance, help with nutritional changes, and also participate in relaxation techniques, and get advice on social, emotional and spiritual… Psychological support is very, very important.\n",
        "I often forget to take the one pill I have to take weekly.\n",
        "I prefer to experience diarrhoea than a headache as my line of work requires lots of concentration. I tend to gain weight — specifically, corticosteroids made me feel like a balloon. I believe that at the end of the day… any side effects worsen quality of life.\n",
        "If they are all severe, diarrhoea is the hardest… every moment of the day going to the toilet can be embarrassing and hits that physical and pride level.\n",
        "The most common thing that a lot of people can’t manage is the diarrhoea, because you’re literally at home and you can’t go anywhere.\n",
        "The sun sensitivity is especially inconvenient as my wife comes from the Caribbean and still wants to travel there and then it would be severe to travel there with such a risk of side effects.\n",
        "I’m already on a cocktail of pills and taking nine more a day is too much to ask.\n",
        "However, in June 2017, test results indicated that the medication wasn’t slowing the scarring as much as was hoped. So, I was switched to the only other available and relatively new drug, nintedanib. I was a bit nauseous initially, but I’ve found a good regime and manage my diet.\n",
        "I was prescribed Esbriet at first but experienced intolerable side effects so the drug was exchanged for OFEV. Is it working? Well, my spirometry test shows little minimal change in the last 6 months.\n",
        "Some people like me don’t can’t seem to absorb or respond to the Zentevia brand and only do well with the Bristol Brand/Quinoric Brand… Mine was switched in July and I landed up in hospital for 6 weeks. I never dreamt that it could be due to a medication brand switch but it was.\n",
        "There are only 2 approved medications to help slow the condition and I have been on both – the first, Pirfenidone, was not as effective as hoped and so I was switched to Nintedanib.\n",
        "Stephen preferred to have diarrhoea and only 2 pills a day instead of vomiting and 9 pills.\n",
        "Oh, over the phone is perfect for me because I don’t want to be going in there at all… the hospital is the worst place in the world to be in these days.\n",
        "There was great support in the knowledge that if I was unwell I could ring… That message was re-enforced many times, that if I needed a bit of help, someone to talk to.\n",
        "Negative\n",
        "You really do miss those (faceto-face) meetings… when you come away from it, it’s absolutely brilliant, it’s just the confidence.\n",
        "I’d be praying night and day that there would not be any changes in my condition… I’d be often worried… I would not be able to self-diagnose myself.\n",
        "For example, if you go to physio, they tell you how to do things [exercises] and then by the time you get home you’ve forgotten it. Whereas, if you’ve got a video, you can always fall back on it and make sure you are doing it correctly.\n",
        "When you go to the doctors you get like seven minutes, the seven minutes finish and I have forgotten, you know what I mean. If you had something on the internet, you could watch it over and over an explain it, you know what I mean, so you can understand it.\n",

        "I’ve often wondered to what extent the diagnosis is exactly correct. When I go online and read about my symptoms, I often find that the same symptoms apply to several diseases under the same umbrella. I’m diagnosed with IPF… some of the treatments seem to be a little bit different. It would be probably quite helpful if there were a genetic test that would say, ‘yeah, this is what you have, not that. And so your treatment should be (this).\n",
        "It would be a real advantage if there was genetic testing developed that might catch something like pulmonary fibrosis right at the very beginning and start treatment right away instead of having it develop and cause lots of scarring before it’s diagnosed.\n",
        "I think it would depend on how invasive it is and how accurate it is. I wouldn’t want it to leave me with more questions that there are no answers for.\n",
        "I have siblings, one issue I think is whether … somebody would actually want to know… Some people would want to live their life accordingly. Others, if they think they’re going to get this terrible disease, they’ll be devastated, and it would really negatively affect their quality of life.\n",

I am determined not to let this disease steal my life… … The pain and distressing fatigue made it difficult to exercise, as well, which led to decreased function and more weight gain. I felt trapped in a distressing cycle of illness ... The damage to my lungs from the sarcoidosis has left me with many limitations but I try not to allow these limitations to stop me from living my best life. I work full- time, I travel, I exercise and interact with my friends and family.\n",

        "Well, if you can’t breathe, you can’t do anything. And at this point of the journey, that’s about where I am. I can do no housework, I can’t even wash my hair. I have to plan everything that I’m going to do that’s going to take energy.\n",

        "Most oxygen providers will provide a home concentrator and either tanks or a portable oxygen concentrator (POC). Initially I ended up purchasing a POC out of pocket because it was difficult to get through insurance. Tanks are very heavy and, depending on your flow rate, you may have to carry more than one tank with you. Last fall I was prescribed a POC with a low continuous flow capability and it took over two months, and several follow-up calls by me… oxygen deliveries can be unreliable and sometimes require that you be home for a full day.\n",

How do you learn to live a fairly productive life when you have a progressive disease and there’s no playbook on what to expect? By filling out quality-of-life questionnaires for the Registry, I want to provide enough data points so that healthcare providers can help their patients work through their struggles.\n",
        "Nevertheless, questions remained, and one of them was worrisome enough to get people to consider an unconventional approach to follow-up research. The problem is that the results that come out of drug studies in mice almost never translate to humans… As a result, we have close to thirty failed drug trials in pulmonary fibrosis alone.\n",
        "I take part in every research study I can… Maybe that information won’t help me, but it may help someone else, maybe my children or grandchildren.\n",
        "Now for the pulmonologist, the breathing is that big target because it’s a measurable thing, but for me the improvement, the quality of life is, can I walk upstairs better, can I perform things better, can I take a shower and put on clothes at the same time within the same hour?

        "I think two hours would be probably the outer limit of length. I could do it, but I just think anything more than that is pushing it ... you’re going to be dealing with people who aren’t always having a good day.\n",
        "There’s a lot of blood tests ... And when I saw this, I thought, wow, that’s a lot. And each time ... each time you get blood tests right for example.\n",

        "If you have a big site … you may have to walk a mile … I can’t do a mile … I don’t typically have a wheelchair, but I might need one for that … it’d be nice to get a shuttle from the parking lot, or get dropped off at a door, or something to know where I’m going and how I could best get there.\n",
        "Either bus passes, or city transit, or parking … or the city passes, or … Uber credits or something along that line is good, because it’s hard for some people to get around.\n",

And then … if there’s anything that needs to be done beforehand. If you tell them up front … maybe that’s a little bit helpful.\n",

        "I would do whatever I needed to do, but I just thought it was much more reasonable than having to travel far, and the fact that you can do some things on the computer. I liked that.\n",

        "Well, I guess that my primary care physician would like to hear about the … regular testing that I will be undergoing throughout the clinical trial … he refers me to other doctors … therefore it’ll be very important for him to know about those tests, the outcomes, the results, how those tests were done.\n",
        "Well the side effects, diarrhoea. I was wondering about that … that really stuck in my mind in terms of concerns.\n",
        "[In the context of discussions about side effects] In principle, I’d like to know everything … I’d like to know if there has been secondary effects, I guess this has already been tried on humans. That’s what I’d like to know.\n",
        "More than the primary care, I think the pulmonologist would be the one who should be informed. The specialist … I think I would be telling him that I’m getting a trial to see what his opinion is. Once I’m in, I would like for him to have the tests and results at his disposal.\n",
        "It’s a really good to have that person [discussing study care navigator] that you know you can always get a hold of because sometimes the doctor … is not available. So having that contact there that is always available … I think to navigate everything and again takes some of that stress level off of you.\n",
        "I think it’s all about mental health and I’m thinking about maybe a psychologist, psychological support, having some visits with a professional where she can really explain or share those concerns. I think it goes around the same idea of the peer group or being linked to this trial beyond just a medical fact, the fact that it’s personally and psychologically giving her something.\n",
        "Well when you have a peer group you can feel more supported. Psychologically it’s really helpful at least for me as a caretaker and for my mom as a patient to be able to share her experience with someone who’s going through the same thing, I think that’s very helpful.\n",
        "At least in studies that I’ve seen, I’ve never seen study partner caregiver compensation. I highly encourage it because they have costs, and they have skin in the game.\n",
        "I’m just worrying if something like that happened, and he needs to be hospitalized, and he needed to be on more prednisone than he normally is ... I see that it’s not permitted.\n",
        "No, the thing that worried me was, if he had to stop any of his meds that he was on now ... when I saw the list of meds, he wouldn’t have to stop any of his regular meds and be taking placebo. I was OK with that even if he was just taking placebo.\n",
        "We went to different hospitals, and they said it’s a sequela of COVID and so we can’t do anything with that. And they don’t have any experience so we can’t do anything.\n",

        "I was pleased it wasn’t cancer.\n",
        "Doctors should be sensitive when delivering a diagnosis and prognosis to patients. The delivery of a diagnosis should not be rushed as the news is life changing. Time should not be an issue.\n",
        "If somebody says to you it’s mild, moderate or severe, all that immediately goes through your mind is does that mean I have a short life or a long one? It doesn’t tell you what you’re faced with.\n",
        "It took me years to get diagnosed and I know this can isolate you so much because you just feel you need to know what is wrong with you so you can deal with it.\n",
        "It is extremely unsettling to have a disease that people say is rare and incurable. The research that I did on ILD was also hopeless pointing to low 5 and 10 year survival rates ... I had a lot of unanswered questions: How would my appearance change? Would I suffer? What other organs would be impacted after my lungs? What did I need to do to ensure the financial stability of my family? What did I need to do so that my family did not need me anymore?\n",
        "The diagnosis was communicated to me in a realistic manner. There is no treatment and no cure but – I remember the doctor emphasised that but – but there is a medicine that gives encouraging results.\n",
        "Being told you have this and there is nothing you can do is frightening. I was told that I wasn’t suitable for transplant, so I felt in a position of no hope. I just had to sit down and take what was coming with no hope, and that was the worst of all.\n",
        "I was told my life expectancy was two to five years and then I was scheduled for a check-up for six months later. I was referred to a physiotherapist to learn breathing exercises. That was it – no other information or support was given.\n",
        "More thought should be given to the psychological impact of being diagnosed with this devastating disease.\n",
        "We were not given a lot of information. Most of what I learned was from attending a support group. I was told when the illness was diagnosed that it was terminal, which came as a shock to both me and my wife.\n",
        "I didn’t know what to do initially ... I tried looking at the internet and the information that was available managed to confuse me even more.\n",
        "I think at diagnosis, obviously, you need to be told that this is not curable and it’s progressive and it will end your life.\n",
        "I think information can be provided in [the] way of a website, or even at the respiratory clinics, little leaflets for people to take. For example, having problems with exercise or keep healthy eating or, you know, when you’re feeling down, these are the resources.\n",
        "[Information] should be available to you very early on, to put you onto the right track of exercise and diet.\n",
        "I think that [what] the website should include, is that you’re not going to keel over from just exerting yourself a little bit. I was really frightened to do any exercise in case I made things worse.\n",
        "The missing link for patients is the lack of information among the GPs. They are not informed about the disease and, in turn, they cannot properly advise patients or refer them to the right specialists.\n",
        "We knew nothing about pulmonary fibrosis when mum received her diagnosis and immediately researched it. Google was not kind and we couldn’t believe something so cruel and terminal was unheard of. Anyone we spoke to about pulmonary fibrosis also hadn’t heard about pulmonary fibrosis and we soon became educators. This really needs to change. There has to be more awareness and support for pulmonary fibrosis sufferers and their families.\n",
        "It was so hard to find information and any doctors or nurses we did talk to had never had a patient with IPF before. So what they maybe heard about or they were comparing it to COPD or other diseases that it really can’t be compared to. There was no information and it was really hard to find, and it felt like we were completely on our own. From what I found online, it was scary; but I figured if that was the case, then her doctor would tell us.\n",
        "[In the context of advanced care planning and end-of-life care] I don’t think the GP knows enough about IPF to be honest because in my experience, they have heard of it but they might have one patient with it but it seems like by the time people are diagnosed, they are too far gone; or it just seems like it’s getting easier to diagnose ... Even the Palliative Care Nurse didn’t know about the oxygen testing and didn’t know about lung disease at all ... So I think they need to be more educated.\n",

        "Keep working with the doctors. I think a lot of the issues in the medical community is that it is still kind of an unknown disease. Especially in those smaller centers, where maybe the doctor has never seen this.\n",
        "I run everything through my GP first. So, once he found out that I have this, he did not know about it. And he told me, I’ve never had a patient like this before. I’m going to learn all about this. And he spent the time learning. He learned on the journey with me, so that’s pretty cool of my doctor.\n",
        "I believe it is important that healthcare professionals are honest with patients and families about the risks, so they can base their decisions on the facts.\n",
        "The support my father got was very good, especially from the specialist nurse who helped him to manage his condition.\n",
        "I have a good relationship with both the nurse and the respiratory therapist. They’ll decide on a plan, and then the nurse communicates with [the ILD physician] or [the rehabilitation/palliative respiratory care physician]. They handle all of that really well. We [patient and the nurse] had a conversation around this ... about how well our relationship is working. And I trust her [the nurse] implicitly to be communicative with [the ILD physician and the rehabilitation/ palliative respiratory care physician].\n",
        "You have full involvement and knowledge in what’s going on. It’s very clear to us she’s [the ILD physician] going to see us through to the end of this and it’s her primary concern to do the best for us that she can. And that’s a very good feeling—a feeling of trust and security. We’re just feeling very lucky to have somebody like her and her entire group because they all have that same approach or philosophy to it all.\n",
        "We were terrified to have those conversations but once we knew for sure that was what was happening, we made it a point to talk about it openly and talk about her fears and concerns and that was huge. That was one thing that Dr. J nailed was being up front. What do you want your death to look like? How do you want to die? What scares you the most about it? And for my mom it was—she didn’t want to be drugged. She wanted to be conscious right until she couldn’t be anymore so they kept that in mind.\n",
        "Do I just go into hospital and I just gasp until I die? But, being reassured by them that I can have a home death, there can be drugs that can help to calm me down, and people there ... Yes. And how caring and supportive the doctors can be. That there are drugs, medications that they can give you to calm you down, so it’s not scary at the end.\n",
        "I ended up in hospital for a week on IV antibiotics and a chest tube. Plus they produced a Green Sleeve, which I’d never seen or heard about until then. I can see their point. They want to get it done before you end up needing resuscitation. But honest to god if you’re short of breath, got pains in your side and feeling lousy, it’s not necessarily the time to be asking you questions about levels of care.\n",
        "And where you want to die and what the different types of experiences look like—so dying in a hospital versus a hospice versus at home. And with each of those different scenarios— the positives and negatives about it ... So it is really just about having those conversations and so people know what to expect and they are not blind-sided by it and making sure that the hospice is willing to work with them. And if they are going to stay at home, what resources are available to them?\n",
        "I think everything should be addressed … There’s so many facets to a terminal disease that you don’t even think about before you’re diagnosed ... It’s really hard ... By being honest. By laying it on the line and telling me this is what we do. This is what we can do. This is what could happen ... It’s very important. It’s one of my biggest fears. But now that I know a bit more about it, I go to a support group that Dr. J spoke about ... and I do feel much better just knowing. I was afraid of the end. Of how violent it could be. From things that I’ve heard … it was very calm and very reassuring.\n",
        "My hope is that oxygen companies will realize that oxygen needs are not a one size fits all across patients and will work more closely and compassionately with patients to ensure their oxygen needs can be met in a way that allows as much quality of life and as little frustration as possible.\n",
        "I know that since my transplant there has been great strides with new drugs to slow down the progression of IPF and research continues to find a cure. I only hope and pray that this will be made possible soon so the need for transplantation will lessen.\n",
        "There was a general lack of understanding of the condition’s progression by GPs and others, and no services available to support patients and their families at the end of life.\n",
        "In my view, the health system let my mother, and us as a family, down badly at the end of her life, due to disjointed services, breakdowns in communication, and the fact that there was no one person to coordinate health and care services. It was truly a traumatic experience.\n",
        "I do feel that unlike cancer patients, pulmonary fibrosis sufferers do not receive the same emotional and mental support to help prepare them through the journey ... Explaining pulmonary fibrosis to anyone was a challenge… This really needs to change as it’s deeply unfair and seems borderline discriminatory. Anyone going through pulmonary fibrosis needs to be supported and understood, just like any other terminal illness. Getting any support for mum was hard because it felt like her condition was not taken seriously until it became dire.\n",
        "My father died of pulmonary fibrosis when I was in college, and that was more than twenty years ago. In all those years, there’s been no change in a patient’s experience with the disease.\n",

This was a massive shock and we felt totally winded. It was unexplainable for us and felt surreal.’\n",

Because, if there was anything crazy [wrong] I think they would tell you.\n",

Number two, I think at some point we’ve got to look at how do we do remote, I know part of a trial has to be controlled, but how do you establish that level of control but also establish remote site capabilities where people aren’t travelling the same distance to get to treatment and to the clinical trial.\n",

        "After participating in the clinical trial, I began to think positively. It’s like catching the lifebuoy in the vast ocean. I was back to the positive and optimistic mindset like I had before. I didn’t feel sad at home or like locking myself in my room. I regularly visited hospital to talk with doctor and nurses.

The waiting time was extremely long when I was receiving the intravenous infusion and for the blood test results. …Once I am told that I can go ahead to receive the drug, they will start thawing it and it takes 30 min, but it’s longer than that, it takes one hour.\n",
        "I had to go back every 2 weeks and again, I was more tired the first 2 days afterwards and things like that, this is what was getting online with other people, we were having the same thing; we were really happy we were living but we wanted to live our life.

That would break out with one thing or another.\n",

        "I started chemotherapy for six months ... My hair and beard thinned and I lost about 30 pounds but my appearance did not change noticeably. I was fatigued, could not eat, felt dizzy and disoriented, my voice became softer and I could not concentrate but soon I learnt the chemotherapy cycle and adjusted to it.\n",
        "I have scleroderma with pulmonary fibrosis and the usual low motility, reflux issues… I am now on Mycophenolate along with prednisolone, folic acid, B12 and esomeprazole amongst other things. Most things are achievable albeit at a different pace to everyone else, I just had to listen to my body and change my way of thinking.\n",
        "I am now on medication that suppresses my immune system. I have a blood test every month and a pulmonary function test every quarter. All indications are that my ILD is stable and has not worsened ... My biggest recourse to cope with my disease is my journal. I confide my fears and my anxieties to my journal. In my journal I try to make sense of specific emotions and try to sort through coping mechanisms.\n",
        "I get very short of breath, the edema is a battle and the water pills just aren't doing their job. I have more reflux and am on Prevacid to help control it. I am also on lots of other drugs; Warfarin, a thyroid medication, Cozaar for the hypertension, and Prednisone. I can't tolerate beta blockers for my heart problems, but I carry nitroglycerin [sic] with me always.\n",

        "A low dose of Baracitinib for my RA. Apparently some rheumatologists don't like prescribing baricitinib to people with lung conditions but I've been taking it for approx 2 years without any detrimental effect on my lungs so far. My respiratory consultant advised me to stop taking methotrexate which I was on when diagnosed. Rheumy have stopped me taking all other DMARDs too, which I think is because of my pulmonary fibrosis.\n",
        "My pulmonary fibrosis is due to Rheumatoid Arthritis, the RA is being actively treated but constantly getting pneumonia requiring hospital admissions.\n",

        "I have pulmonary fibrosis caused by the treatment I had for AF. I had amiodarone, which is known to cause lung problems, and then dronedarone, which is safer. Unfortunately I developed pulmonary fibrosis.\n",
        "Where now, I don't have that sensitivity in the fingertips. It will turn purple, it will hurt but not as bad as in the beginning when I was diagnosed. I used to get sores-I used to get digital ulcers and scars and sores, and now I don't. Fingers turn blue but I don't get the sores.\n",
        "I was diagnosed with sarcoidosis at the age of 31. At the time of diagnosis I had no symptoms, I was athletic and completely healthy. I had no idea the impact it would come to have on my life. As the years went on I began to have flare-ups. These flare-ups forced me to make many physical and psychosocial adjustments.\n",
        "Have been diagnosed this by my respiratory consultant due to decrease in my lung function tests.\n",
        "I was diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis approx 5 years ago. My respiratory consultant believes it RA related and I've no reason to doubt him as I'm as sure as I can be that my lungs were damaged during a prolonged RA flare.\n",
        "I have a good relationship with both the nurse and the respiratory therapist. ... They’ll decide on a plan, and then the nurse communicates with [the ILD physician] or [the rehabilitation/palliative respiratory care physician]. They handle all of that really well ... We [patient and the nurse] had a conversation around this ... about how well our relationship is working ... And I trust her [the nurse] implicitly to be communicative with [the ILD physician and the rehabilitation/palliative respiratory care physician].\n",
